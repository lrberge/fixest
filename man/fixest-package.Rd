\title{Fast and User-Friendly Fixed-Effects Estimations}
\description{
The package \pkg{fixest} provides a family of functions to perform estimations with multiple fixed-effects. Standard-errors can be easily and intuitively clustered. It also includes tools to seamlessly export (to Latex) the results of various estimations.
}
\details{
This package efficiently estimates models with multiple fixed-effect (i.e. multiple large factor variables).

The core functions are: \code{\link[fixest]{feols}}, \code{\link[fixest]{feglm}} and \code{\link[fixest]{femlm}} to estimate, respectively, linear models, generalized linear models and maximum likelihood models with multiple fixed-effects. The function \code{\link[fixest]{feNmlm}} allows the inclusion of non-linear in parameters right hand sides. Finally \code{\link[fixest]{fepois}} and \code{\link[fixest]{fenegbin}} are shorthands to estimate Poisson and Negative Binomial models.

Note that the functions \code{\link[fixest]{feglm}} and \code{\link[fixest]{femlm}} provide the same results when using the same families but differ in that the latter is a direct maximum likelihood optimization (so the two can really have different convergence rate).

Several features are also included such as the possibility to easily compute different types of standard-errors (including multi-way clustering).

It is possible to compare the results of severeal estimations by using the function \code{\link[fixest]{esttable}}, and to export them to Latex using \code{\link[fixest]{esttex}}.
