\arguments{
\item{fml}{A formula representing the relation to be estimated. For example: \code{fml = z~x+y}. To include fixed-effects, insert them in this formula using a pipe: e.g. \code{fml = z~x+y | fe_1+fe_2}. You can combine two fixed-effects with \code{^}: e.g. \code{fml = z~x+y|fe_1^fe_2}, see details. You can also use variables with varying slopes using square brackets: e.g. in \code{fml = z~y|fe_1[x] + fe_2}, see details. To add IVs, insert the endogenous vars./instruments after a pipe, like in \code{y ~ x | c(x_endo1, x_endo2) ~ x_inst1 + x_inst2}. Note that it should always be the last element, see details. Multiple estimations can be performed at once: for multiple dep. vars, wrap them in \code{c()}: ex \code{c(y1, y2)}. For multiple indep. vars, use the stepwise functions: ex \code{x1 + csw(x2, x3)}. The formula \code{fml = c(y1, y2) ~ x1 + cw0(x2, x3)} leads to 6 estimation, see details.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the necessary variables to run the model. The variables of the non-linear right hand side of the formula are identified with this \code{data.frame} names. Can also be a matrix.}

\item{weights}{A formula or a numeric vector. Each observation can be weighted, the weights must be greater than 0. If equal to a formula, it should be one-sided: for example \code{~ var_weight}.}

\item{offset}{A formula or a numeric vector. An offset can be added to the estimation. If equal to a formula, it should be of the form (for example) \code{~0.5*x**2}. This offset is linearly added to the elements of the main formula 'fml'.}

\item{subset}{A vector (logical or numeric) or a one-sided formula. If provided, then the estimation will be performed only on the observations defined by this argument.}

\item{split}{A one sided formula representing a variable (eg \code{split = ~var}) or a vector. If provided, the sample is split according to the variable and one estimation is performed for each value of that variable. If you also want to include the estimation for the full sample, use the argument \code{fsplit} instead.}

\item{fsplit}{A one sided formula representing a variable (eg \code{split = ~var}) or a vector. If provided, the sample is split according to the variable and one estimation is performed for each value of that variable. This argument is the same as split but also includes the full sample as the first estimation.}

\item{cluster}{Tells how to cluster the standard-errors (if clustering is requested). Can be either a list of vectors, a character vector of variable names, a formula or an integer vector. Assume we want to perform 2-way clustering over \code{var1} and \code{var2} contained in the data.frame \code{base} used for the estimation. All the following \code{cluster} arguments are valid and do the same thing: \code{cluster = base[, c("var1", "var2")]}, \code{cluster = c("var1", "var2")}, \code{cluster = ~var1+var2}. If the two variables were used as clusters in the estimation, you could further use \code{cluster = 1:2} or leave it blank with \code{se = "twoway"} (assuming \code{var1} [resp. \code{var2}] was the 1st [res. 2nd] cluster). You can interact two variables using \code{^} with the following syntax: \code{cluster = ~var1^var2} or \code{cluster = "var1^var2"}.}

\item{se}{Character scalar. Which kind of standard error should be computed: \dQuote{standard}, \dQuote{hetero}, \dQuote{cluster}, \dQuote{twoway}, \dQuote{threeway} or \dQuote{fourway}? By default if there are clusters in the estimation: \code{se = "cluster"}, otherwise \code{se = "standard"}. Note that this argument can be implicitly deduced from the argument \code{cluster}.}

\item{dof}{An object of class \code{dof.type} obtained with the function \code{\link[fixest]{dof}}. Represents how the degree of freedom correction should be done.You must use the function \code{\link[fixest]{dof}} for this argument. The arguments and defaults of the function \code{\link[fixest]{dof}} are: \code{adj = TRUE}, \code{fixef.K="nested"}, \code{cluster.adj = TRUE}, \code{cluster.df = "conventional"}, \code{t.df = "conventional"}, \code{fixef.force_exact=FALSE)}. See the help of the function \code{\link[fixest]{dof}} for details.}

\item{panel.id}{The panel identifiers. Can either be: i) a one sided formula (e.g. \code{panel.id = ~id+time}), ii) a character vector of length 2 (e.g. \code{panel.id=c('id', 'time')}, or iii) a character scalar of two variables separated by a comma (e.g. \code{panel.id='id,time'}). Note that you can combine variables with \code{^} only inside formulas (see the dedicated section in \code{\link[fixest]{feols}}).}

\item{fixef}{Character vector. The names of variables to be used as fixed-effects. These variables should contain the identifier of each observation (e.g., think of it as a panel identifier). Note that the recommended way to include fixed-effects is to insert them directly in the formula.}

\item{fixef.rm}{Can be equal to "perfect" (default), "singleton", "both" or "none". Controls which observations are to be removed. If "perfect", then observations having a fixed-effect with perfect fit (e.g. only 0 outcomes in Poisson estimations) will be removed. If "singleton", all observations for which a fixed-effect appears only once will be removed. The meaning of "both" and "none" is direct.}

\item{fixef.tol}{Precision used to obtain the fixed-effects. Defaults to \code{1e-5}. It corresponds to the maximum absolute difference allowed between two coefficients of successive iterations. Argument \code{fixef.tol} cannot be lower than \code{10000*.Machine$double.eps}. Note that this parameter is dynamically controlled by the algorithm.}

\item{fixef.iter}{Maximum number of iterations in fixed-effects algorithm (only in use for 2+ fixed-effects). Default is 10000.}

\item{collin.tol}{Numeric scalar, default is \code{1e-4}. Threshold deciding when variables should be considered collinear and subsequently removed from the estimation. Higher values means more variables will be removed (if there is presence of collinearity). One signal of presence of collinearity is t-stats that are extremely low (for instance when t-stats < 1e-3).}

\item{nthreads}{The number of threads. Can be: a) an integer lower than, or equal to, the maximum number of threads; b) 0: meaning all available threads will be used; c) a number strictly between 0 and 1 which represents the fraction of all threads to use. The default is to use 50\% of all threads. You can set permanently the number of threads used within this package using the function \code{\link[fixest]{setFixest_nthreads}}.}

\item{lean}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} then all large objects are removed from the returned result: this will save memory but will block the possibility to use many methods. It is recommended to use the arguments \code{se} or \code{cluster} to obtain the appropriate standard-errors at estimation time, since obtaining different SEs won't be possible afterwards.}

\item{verbose}{Integer. Higher values give more information. In particular, it can detail the number of iterations in the demeaning algorithm (the first number is the left-hand-side, the other numbers are the right-hand-side variables).}

\item{warn}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Whether warnings should be displayed (concerns warnings relating to convergence state).}

\item{notes}{Logical. By default, two notes are displayed: when NAs are removed (to show additional information) and when some observations are removed because of collinearity. To avoid displaying these messages, you can set \code{notes = FALSE}. You can remove these messages permanently by using \code{setFixest_notes(FALSE)}.}

\item{combine.quick}{Logical. When you combine different variables to transform them into a single fixed-effects you can do e.g. \code{y ~ x | paste(var1, var2)}. The algorithm provides a shorthand to do the same operation: \code{y ~ x | var1^var2}. Because pasting variables is a costly operation, the internal algorithm may use a numerical trick to hasten the process. The cost of doing so is that you lose the labels. If you are interested in getting the value of the fixed-effects coefficients after the estimation, you should use \code{combine.quick = FALSE}. By default it is equal to \code{FALSE} if the number of observations is lower than 50,000, and to \code{TRUE} otherwise.}

\item{demeaned}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. Only used in the presence of fixed-effects: should the centered variables be returned? If \code{TRUE}, it creates the items \code{y_demeaned} and \code{X_demeaned}.}

\item{mem.clean}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. Only to be used if the data set is large compared to the available RAM. If \code{TRUE} then intermediary objects are removed as much as possible and \code{\link[base]{gc}} is run before each substantial C++ section in the internal code to avoid memory issues.}

\item{only.env}{(Advanced users.) Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, then only the environment used to make the estimation is returned.}

\item{env}{(Advanced users.) A \code{fixest} environment created by a \code{fixest} estimation with \code{only.env = TRUE}. Default is missing. If provided, the data from this environment will be used to perform the estimation.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\description{
Estimates OLS with any number of fixed-effects.
}
\details{
The method used to demean each variable along the fixed-effects is based on Berge (2018), since this is the same problem to solve as for the Gaussian case in a ML setup.
}
\section{Combining the fixed-effects}{

You can combine two variables to make it a new fixed-effect using \code{^}. The syntax is as follows: \code{fe_1^fe_2}. Here you created a new variable which is the combination of the two variables fe_1 and fe_2. This is identical to doing \code{paste0(fe_1, "_", fe_2)} but more convenient.

Note that pasting is a costly operation, especially for large data sets. Thus, the internal algorithm uses a numerical trick which is fast, but the drawback is that the identity of each observation is lost (i.e. they are now equal to a meaningless number instead of being equal to \code{paste0(fe_1, "_", fe_2)}). These \dQuote{identities} are useful only if you're interested in the value of the fixed-effects (that you can extract with \code{\link[fixest]{fixef.fixest}}). If you're only interested in coefficients of the variables, it doesn't matter. Anyway, you can use \code{combine.quick = FALSE} to tell the internal algorithm to use \code{paste} instead of the numerical trick. By default, the numerical trick is performed only for large data sets.
}

\section{Varying slopes}{

You can add variables with varying slopes in the fixed-effect part of the formula. The syntax is as follows: fixef_var[var1, var2]. Here the variables var1 and var2 will be with varying slopes (one slope per value in fixef_var) and the fixed-effect fixef_var will also be added.

To add only the variables with varying slopes and not the fixed-effect, use double square brackets: fixef_var[[var1, var2]].

In other words:
\itemize{
  \item fixef_var[var1, var2] is equivalent to fixef_var + fixef_var[[var1]] + fixef_var[[var2]]
  \item fixef_var[[var1, var2]] is equivalent to fixef_var[[var1]] + fixef_var[[var2]]
}

In general, for convergence reasons, it is recommended to always add the fixed-effect and avoid using only the variable with varying slope (i.e. use single square brackets).
}

\section{Lagging variables}{


To use leads/lags of variables in the estimation, you can: i) either provide the argument \code{panel.id}, ii) either set your data set as a panel with the function \code{\link[fixest]{panel}}. Doing either of the two will give you acceess to the lagging functions \code{\link[fixest]{l}},  \code{\link[fixest:l]{f}} and \code{\link[fixest:l]{d}}.

You can provide several leads/lags/differences at once: e.g. if your formula is equal to \code{f(y) ~ l(x, -1:1)}, it means that the dependent variable is equal to the lead of \code{y}, and you will have as explanatory variables the lead of \code{x1}, \code{x1} and the lag of \code{x1}. See the examples in function \code{\link[fixest]{l}} for more details.
}

\section{Interactions}{


You can interact a numeric variable with a "factor-like" variable by using \code{interact(var, fe, ref)}, where \code{fe} is the variable to be interacted with and the argument \code{ref} is a value of \code{fe} taken as a reference (optional). Instead of using the function \code{\link[fixest:i]{interact}}, you can use the alias \code{i(var, fe, ref)}.

Using this specific way to create interactions leads to a different display of the interacted values in \code{\link[fixest]{etable}} and offers a special representation of the interacted coefficients in the function \code{\link[fixest]{coefplot}}. See examples.

 It is important to note that *if you do not care about the standard-errors of the interactions*, then you can add interactions in the fixed-effects part of the formula (using the syntax fe[[var]], as explained in the section \dQuote{Varying slopes}).

The function \code{\link[fixest:i]{interact}} has in fact more arguments, please see details in its associated help page.
}

\section{On standard-errors}{


Standard-errors can be computed in different ways, you can use the arguments \code{se} and \code{dof} in \code{\link[fixest]{summary.fixest}} to define how to compute them. By default, in the presence of fixed-effects, standard-errors are automatically clustered.

The following vignette: \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=fixest/vignettes/standard_errors.html}{On standard-errors} describes in details how the standard-errors are computed in \code{fixest} and how you can replicate standard-errors from other software.

You can use the functions \code{\link[fixest]{setFixest_se}} and \code{\link[fixest:dof]{setFixest_dof}} to permanently set the way the standard-errors are computed.
}

\section{Instrumental variables}{


To estimate two stage least square regressions, insert the relationship between the endogenous regressor(s) and the instruments in a formula, after a pipe.

For example, \code{fml = y ~ x1 | x_endo ~ x_inst} will use the variables \code{x1} and \code{x_inst} in the first stage to explain \code{x_endo}. Then will use the fitted value of \code{x_endo} (which will be named \code{fit_x_endo}) and \code{x1} to explain \code{y}.
To include several endogenous regressors, just use "+", like in: \code{fml = y ~ x1 | x_endo1 + x_end2 ~ x_inst1 + x_inst2}.

Of course you can still add the fixed-effects, but the IV formula must always come last, like in \code{fml = y ~ x1 | fe1 + fe2 | x_endo ~ x_inst}.

By default, the second stage regression is returned. You can access the first stage(s) regressions either directly in the slot \code{iv_first_stage} (not recommended), or using the argument \code{stage = 1} from the function \code{\link[fixest]{summary.fixest}}. For example \code{summary(iv_est, stage = 1)} will give the first stage(s). Note that using summary you can display both the second and first stages at the same time using, e.g., \code{stage = 1:2} (using \code{2:1} would reverse the order).
}

\section{Multiple estimations}{


Multiple estimations can be performed at once, they just have to be specified in the formula. Multiple estimations yield a \code{fixest_multi} object which is \sQuote{kind of} a list of all the results but includes specific methods to access the results in a handy way.

To include mutliple dependent variables, wrap them in \code{c()} (\code{list()} also works). For instance \code{fml = c(y1, y2) ~ x1} would estimate the model \code{fml = y1 ~ x1} and then the model \code{fml = y2 ~ x1}.

To include multiple independent variables, you need to use the stepwise functions. There are 4 stepwise functions associated to 4 short aliases. These are a) stepwise, stepwise0, cstepwise, cstepwise0, and b) sw, sw0, csw, csw0. Let's explain that.
Assume you have the following formula: \code{fml = y ~ x1 + sw(x2, x3)}. The stepwise function \code{sw} will estimate the following two models: \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{y ~ x1 + x3}. That is, each element in \code{sw()} is sequentially, and separately, added to the formula. Would have you used \code{sw0} in lieu of \code{sw}, then the model \code{y ~ x1} would also have been estimated. The \code{0} in the name means that the model wihtout any stepwise element also needs to be estimated.
Finally, the prefix \code{c} means cumulative: each stepwise element is added to the next. That is, \code{fml = y ~ x1 + csw(x2, x3)} would lead to the following models \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + x3}. The \code{0} has the same meaning and would also lead to the model without the stepwise elements to be estimated: in other words, \code{fml = y ~ x1 + csw0(x2, x3)} leads to the following three models: \code{y ~ x1}, \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + x3}.

Multiple independent variables can be combined with multiple dependent variables, as in \code{fml = c(y1, y2) ~ cw(x1, x2, x3)} which would lead to 6 estimations. Multiple estimations can also be combined to split samples (with the arguments \code{split}, \code{fsplit}).

Fixed-effects cannot be included in a stepwise fashion: they are there or not and stay the same for all estimations.

A note on performance. The feature of multiple estimations has been highly optimized for \code{feols}, in particular in the presence of fixed-effects. It is faster to estimate multiple models using the formula rather than with a loop. For non-\code{feols} models using the formula is roughly similar to using a loop performance-wise.
