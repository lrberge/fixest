\title{R2s of \code{fixest} models}
\usage{
r2(x, type = "all", full_names = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{fixest} object, e.g. obtained with function \code{\link{feglm}} or \code{\link{feols}}.}

\item{type}{A character vector representing the R2 to compute. The R2 codes are of the form: "wapr2" with letters "w" (within), "a" (adjusted) and "p" (pseudo) possibly missing. E.g. to get the regular R2: use \code{type = "r2"}, the within adjusted R2: use \code{type = "war2"}, the pseudo R2: use \code{type = "pr2"}, etc. Use \code{"cor2"} for the squared correlation. By default, all R2s are computed.}

\item{full_names}{Logical scalar, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} then names of the vector in output will have full names instead of keywords (e.g. \verb{Squared Correlation} instead of \code{cor2}, etc).}
}
\value{
Returns a named vector.
}
\description{
Reports different R2s for \code{fixest} estimations (e.g. \code{\link{feglm}} or \code{\link{feols}}).
}
\details{
The pseudo R2s are the McFaddens R2s, that is the ratio of log-likelihoods.

For R2s with no theoretical justification, like e.g. regular R2s for maximum likelihood models -- or within R2s for models without fixed-effects, NA is returned. The single measure to possibly compare all kinds of models is the squared correlation between the dependent variable and the expected predictor.

The pseudo-R2 is also returned in the OLS case, it corresponds to the pseudo-R2 of the equivalent GLM model with a Gaussian family.

For the adjusted within-R2s, the adjustment factor is \code{(n - nb_fe) / (n - nb_fe - K)} with \code{n} the number of observations, \code{nb_fe} the number of fixed-effects and \code{K} the number of variables.

\examples{

# Load trade data
data(trade)

# We estimate the effect of distance on trade (with 3 fixed-effects)
est = feols(log(Euros) ~ log(dist_km)|Origin+Destination+Product, trade)

# Squared correlation:
r2(est, "cor2")

# "regular" r2:
r2(est, "r2")

# pseudo r2 (equivalent to GLM with Gaussian family)
r2(est, "pr2")

# adjusted within r2
r2(est, "war2")

# all four at once
r2(est, c("cor2", "r2", "pr2", "war2"))

# same with full names instead of codes
r2(est, c("cor2", "r2", "pr2", "war2"), full_names = TRUE)
