```

`fixest` offers a tool, the function `etable`, to view estimation tables in `R` or export them to Latex. 

The main advantage of this function is its simplicity: it is completely integrated with other `fixest` functions, making it exceedingly easy to export multiple estimation results with, say, different types of standard-errors. On the other hand, its main limitations are that *i)* only `fixest` objects can be exported, and *ii)* only Latex is supported (although the use of post-processing functions opens up a lot of possibilities). 

It also offers a fair deal of customization, and since you can seamlessly change its default values, you can completely transform the style of your tables without modifying a single line of code. 

Note that there exists excellent alternatives to export tables, like for instance [modelsummary](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modelsummary) (if you don't know it already, please do have a look, it's really great!); but they are less integrated with `fixest` objects, possibly necessitating more lines of code to export the same results. 

This document does not describe `etable`'s arguments in details (the help page provides many examples). Rather, it illustrates some features that may be hidden at first sight.

This document applies to `fixest` version 0.10.2 or higher.

## Preliminaries

Throughout this document, we will use data from the *airquality* data base. We also set a dictionary that will be used to rename the variables used in `etable`. This dictionary is set once and for all.

```{r, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}
library(fixest)
data(airquality)

# Setting a dictionary 
setFixest_dict(c(Ozone = "Ozone (ppb)", Solar.R = "Solar Radiation (Langleys)",
                 Wind = "Wind Speed (mph)", Temp = "Temperature"))
```


## Exporting multiple estimations to data.frames

Let's estimate the following four models and cluster the standard-errors by `Day`:
```{r}
# On multiple estimations: see the dedicated vignette
est = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + sw0(Wind + Temp) | csw(Month, Day), 
            airquality, cluster = ~Day)
```

By default, when the argument `file` is missing, the function `etable` returns a `data.frame`. Let's see the output of the previous estimations:

```{r}
etable(est)
```

What can we notice? First, the variables are properly labeled. Second, the fixed-effects section details which fixed-effects is included in which model. Third, the type of standard-error is reminded in a dedicated row. 

Starting from this table, two elements are detailed: a) how to change the look of the table with the `style.df` argument, b) how to leverage tools from other packages with the `postprocess.df` argument.

### Changing the look of the data.frame with `style.df`

You can change many elements of the `data.frame` with the argument `style.df` whose input must come from the function `style.df`. The style monitors many elements of the table, in particular the titles of the sections. Let's have an example:

```{r}
etable(est, style.df = style.df(depvar.title = "", fixef.title = "", 
                                fixef.suffix = " fixed effect", yesNo = "yes"))
```

In the previous example, the dependent variable and fixed-effects (FE) headers have been removed, and this is achieved with the (explicit) arguments `depvar.title` and `fixef.title`. Furthermore the suffix `"fixed effect"` is added to each fixed-effect variable, and the indicator of which FE is included in which model is slightly changed. There are more options that are described in the `style.df` documentation.

#### Postprocessing with external functions

Since the output of `etable` is a `data.frame`, any formatting function handling `data.frame`s can be leveraged. It is then very easy to integrate it into `etable`. Let's have an example with the package `pander`:

```{r, eval = !is_pander, include = !is_pander}
# NOTE:
# The evaluation of the code of this section requires the 
#   package 'pander' which is not installed.
# The code output is not reported.
```

```{r, eval = is_pander}
library(pander)

etable(est, postprocess.df = pandoc.table.return, style = "rmarkdown")
```

What did it do? First, it called the function `pandoc.table.return` from within `etable`. Second, the argument `style` is not from `etable` but is from `pander`'s function. Indeed, all the arguments to the postprocessing function are caught and passed to it. So far so good. But you could say: why bother using the posprocessing function when we could just use piping? You're right, but wait a second for the next section. 


#### Setting `etable` default values

One important feature of `etable` is that you can set the default values of almost all its arguments. This includes the postprocessing function. Let's change the default values of `style.df` and `postprocess.df`:

```{r, eval = is_pander}
my_style = style.df(depvar.title = "", fixef.title = "", 
                    fixef.suffix = " fixed effect", yesNo = "yes")
setFixest_etable(style.df = my_style, postprocess.df = pandoc.table.return)
```

Since now `pandoc.table.return` is the default postprocessing, *all its arguments are added to `etable`*. So calls like that are valid even though `style` or `caption` are *not* arguments from `etable`:

```{r, eval = is_pand, eval = is_pander}
etable(est[rhs = 2], style = "rmarkdown", caption = "New default values")
```

## Exporting multiple estimations to Latex

We now illustrate the exports to Latex. First, to include all the sections of a table, let's add a fifth estimation to the previous example; this new estimation includes variables with varying slopes:

```{r}
est_slopes = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind | Day + Month[Temp], airquality)
```

To export to Latex, use the argument `tex = TRUE` (note that this argument is on when the argument `file` is not missing):

```{r, results = 'hide'}
etable(est, est_slopes, tex = TRUE)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# etable(est, est_slopes, file = "../_VIGNETTES/vignette_etable.tex", replace = TRUE)
# etable(est, est_slopes, file = "../_VIGNETTES/vignette_etable.tex", style.tex = style.tex("aer"), fitstat = ~ r2 + n, signif.code = NA)
```

The previous code produces the following table:

![](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest/blob/master/vignettes/images/etable/first_table.PNG?raw=true)

The style of the table is rather sober, but no worries: most of it can be customized. We now illustrate: a) how to change the look of the table with the argument `style.tex`, and how to include custom features with the argument `postproces.tex`.

### Changing the look of the Latex table with `style.tex`

The argument `style.tex` defines how the table looks. It allows an in-depth customization of the table. The table is split into several components, each allowing some customization. The components of a table and some of its associated keywords are described by the following figure:

![](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest/blob/master/vignettes/images/etable/style_explanation.png?raw=true)

The argument `style.tex` only accepts outputs from the function `style.tex`. That function is documented and describes the different components that can be found in the previous illustration. 

The function `style.tex` has two starting points (in the argument `main`), either the style of the first table displayed, either a much more compact style named "aer". Let's show the same table with the aer style, without stars beside the coefficients, and different fit statistics:

```{r, results = 'hide'}
etable(est, est_slopes, style.tex = style.tex("aer"), 
       signif.code = NA, fitstat = ~ r2 + n, tex = TRUE)
```

Which yields the following table:

![](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest/blob/master/vignettes/images/etable/table_new_style.PNG?raw=true)


### Adding custom features with `postprocess.tex`

When `tex = TRUE` `etable` returns a character vector. It is possible to modify it at will with the argument `postprocess.tex`. When a postprocessing function is detected, two additional tags are added to the character vector identifying the start and end of the table (`"%start:tab\\n"` and `"%end:tab\\n"`). 

Assume we want to set the rule widths of the table, we could write the following function:

```{r}
set_rules = function(x, heavy, light){
  # x: the character vector returned by etable
  
  tex2add = ""
  if(!missing(heavy)){
    tex2add = paste0("\\setlength\\heavyrulewidth{", heavy, "}\n")
  }
  if(!missing(light)){
    tex2add = paste0(tex2add, "\\setlength\\lightrulewidth{", light, "}\n")
  }
  
  if(nchar(tex2add) > 0){
    x[x == "%start:tab\n"] = tex2add
  }
  
  x
}
```

Now we can summon that function from `etable`:

```{r, results = 'hide'}
etable(est, est_slopes, postprocess.tex = set_rules, heavy = "0.14em", tex = TRUE)
```

Of course it is even more convenient to set `set_rules` as the default postprocessing function.

#### Setting `etable` default values: Latex edition

To set the default values, like for the data.frame output, use `setFixest_etable`:

```{r}
setFixest_etable(style.tex = style.tex("aer", signif.code = NA), postprocess.tex = set_rules, 
                 fitstat = ~ r2 + n)
```

Now we can access directly the arguments of the postprocessing function and the default style is the one of the second table:

```{r}
etable(est, heavy = "0.14em", tex = TRUE)
```

## Setting custom fit statistics

It is often useful to include in a table some fit statistics that are not standard, or simply that may not be included in `fixest` built-in fit statistics. While it is possible to include any extra line in the table with the argument `extralines`, this is rather cumbersome and possibly error-prone if this task has to be repeated.

To avoid that kind of issue, `fixest` allows the user to register custom fit statistics. Once they are registered, they can be seamlessly called via the `fitstat` argument in `etable`.

Let's continue with the previous example using the `airquality` data set, and now let's display different p-values of statistical significance for the variable `Solar.R`. These p-values will vary depending on how we compute the VCOV matrix.

Here is an example that will shortly be explained:

```{r}
fitstat_register(type = "p_s", alias = "pvalue (standard)",
                 fun = function(x) pvalue(x, vcov = "iid")["Solar.R"])

fitstat_register(type = "p_h", alias = "pvalue (Heterosk.)",
                 fun = function(x) pvalue(x, vcov = "hetero")["Solar.R"])

fitstat_register(type = "p_day", alias = "pvalue (Day)",
                 fun = function(x) pvalue(x, vcov = ~Day)["Solar.R"])

fitstat_register(type = "p_month", alias = "pvalue (Month)",
                 fun = function(x) pvalue(x, vcov = ~Month)["Solar.R"])

# We first reset the default values set in the previous sections
setFixest_etable(reset = TRUE)
# Now we display the results with the new fit statistics
etable(est, fitstat = ~ . + p_s + p_h + p_day + p_month)
```

The function `fitstat_register` is a tool to add fit statistics in the `fitstat` engine. The first argument, `type`, is the code name by which the statistic is to be summoned. The argument `alias` provides the row name of the statistics: how it should look in the table. Finally in the `fun` argument is the function computing the statistic. That function must apply to a `fixest` estimation and must also return a single value.

Once these statistics are registered, they can seamlessly be summoned with the argument `fitstat` and will appear in the order the user provide. Note that the dot in `fitstat = ~ . + p_s + etc` represents the default statistics to be displayed and need not be there.


## Using external functions to export multiple results

Thanks to contributors (namely Karl Dunkle Werner), `fixest` objects are compatible with [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/index.html) methods. This means that export functions building on `broom` can be leveraged, like for instance the excellent [modelsummary](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary).

In case you use external export tools, here are some tips.

Multiple estimations, like the object `est` in the previous examples, are a bit special and `broom` methods can't apply directly. To export them, you first need to coerce the results into a list: by simply using `as.list(est)`.

By default in `fixest` the estimations are separated from the calculation of the VCOV matrices. That's not a problem when using `etable` since, after providing the argument `se` or `cluster`, all VCOVs are calculated at once. Using other tools for exportation requires a call to `summary` for each model to compute the appropriate standard-errors. But this process can also be automatized. The function `.l()` can be used to coerce several `fixest` objects to which `summary` can then be applied, for example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(.l(est, est_slopes), cluster = ~ Month)
```

The previous code returns a list of the five estimations for which the standard-errors are all clustered at the Month level, and can then be exported with external software.
