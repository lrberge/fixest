`fixest` offers a simple tool, the function `etable`, to export estimation tables to Latex. The main advantage of this function is its simplicity, many adjustments being made automatically behind the scene. 

Its main limitations are that *i)* only `fixest` objects can be exported, and *ii)* only Latex is supported. Thus by no means it competes with other excellent tools to export tables in various format (like for instance [modelsummary](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modelsummary) or [texreg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=texreg)). 

It offers however a fair deal of customization, and since you can seamlessly change its default values, you can completely transform the style of your tables without modifying a single line of code. 

This document does not describe `etable`'s arguments in details (since it's in the help pages). Rather, it illustrates how to change the style of the table, once and for all.

## First example

Using data from the *airquality* data base, let's estimate 5 models:

```{r}
library(fixest)
data(airquality)

setFixest_notes(FALSE) # To avoid messages when NAs are removed

est_noFE = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp, airquality)
est_1FE  = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp | Day, airquality)
est_2FE  = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp | Day + Month , airquality)
est_poly = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + poly(Temp, 3) | Day + Month, airquality)
```

To export the results to Latex, we use `etable`. We first set the dictionnary renaming the variables, then we export the results with clustered standard-errors at the Day level:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Dictionary => set only once per session
setFixest_dict(c(Ozone = "Ozone (ppb)", Solar.R = "Solar Radiation (Langleys)",
                 Wind = "Wind Speed (mph)", Temp = "Temperature (Fahrenheit)"))

etable(est_noFE, est_1FE, est_2FE, est_poly, est_slopes, cluster = "Day", file = file,
       group = list("Temperature (cubic)" = "poly"), notes = "Estimation of 5 models.")

```

The previous code produces the following table:

What can we notice? First, all variables are appropriately labeled. Second, all standard-errors of the four models are clustered by Day, and this is mentioned in the table footer. This is achieved with the argument `cluster`. Third, there's a fixed-effects section telling which model has which fixed-effect. Fourth, the polynomial of the Temperature is not shown, instead there's a line telling which model includes a cubic polynomial. This is achieved with the argument `group`. 

The style of the table is rather sober, but no worries most of it can be customized.


## Setting the style, once and for all

The argument `style` defines how the table looks. It allows an in-depth customization of the table. The tables is split into several components, each allowing some customization. The components of a table and some of its associated keywords are described by the following figure:

![](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest/blob/master/vignettes/images/etable/style_explanation.png?raw=true)

The argument `style` must be a list, the names of which correspond to the different components. Each element of this list must be a single character string of the form `"keyword1:value1; keyword2:value; etc"`. The missing components fall back to their default values. The components, with the keywords they accept and their defaults are:

 - **depvar**: *title*. Default `"title:Dependent Variable(s):"`.
 - **model**: *title, format*. Default `"title:Model:; format:(1)"`. In `format`, you can use the special values 1, i, I, a or A; the corresponding values will be increased across the model columns.
 - **var**: *title*. Default `"title:\\emph{Variables}"`.
 - **fixef**: *title, prefix, suffix, where*. Default `"title:\\emph{Fixed-effects}; where:var"`. Valid values of `where` are "var" or "stats".
 - **slopes**: *title, format*.  Default `"title:\\emph{Varying Slopes}; format:__var__ (__slope__)"`. In `format`, the special values \_\_var\_\_ and \_\_slope\_\_ are replaced with the corresponding labels of the variables and of the slope.
 - **stats**: *title*.  Default `"title:\\emph{Fit statistics}"`.
 - **notes**: *title*.  Default `"title:\\emph{\\medskip Notes:} "`.
 - **lines**: *top, foot, bottom, sep*.  Default `"top:\\tabularnewline\\toprule\\toprule;bottom:;foot:\\bottomrule\\bottomrule;sep:\\midrule"`.

Missing keywords are considered to be equal to the empty string.

Now the `style` argument is illustrated along with the modification of default values.

#### Changing the default values

To permanently change the default values for function `etable`, just use the function `setFixest_etable`:

```{r}
new_style = list(lines = "top:\\toprule; bottom:\\bottomrule",
                 var = "title:\\midrule", # cleans the title but keeps line
                 depvar = "", # cleans the title
                 model = "format:$Model_{I}$",  # cleans the titles + changes model format
                 fixef = "title: ; suffix: fixed effects; where:stats",
                 # fixef: cleans the titles + adds a suffix + places after the stats
                 slopes = "format:__var__ $\\times $ __slope__",
                 stats = "title: ") # cleans the title but adds an empty line

setFixest_etable(fitstat = ~r2, signifCode = NA, yesNo = "$\\checkmark$",
                 tablefoot = FALSE, style = new_style)
```

And now, using the exact same line of code as in the first example, we obtain a table with a different style:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
etable(est_noFE, est_1FE, est_2FE, est_poly, est_slopes, cluster = "Day", file = file,
       group = list("Temperature (cubic)" = "poly"), notes = "Estimation of 5 models.")
```
